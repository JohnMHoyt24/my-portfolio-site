                    I'm like that contractor who built your
                    house, but I build fun things on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a passionate web developer who is both college-educated
                    and self-taught. Ever since taking a web development course in
                    college, I have been enthusiastic about creating websites and
                    web apps. This is my place to showcase my work and skills.
                    Make yourself a warm cup of coffee &#9749; or grab your favorite
                    drink &#129380; and take a look around.

                    If you're interested in my work, let's chat.
                    I'm always open to new opportunities!
